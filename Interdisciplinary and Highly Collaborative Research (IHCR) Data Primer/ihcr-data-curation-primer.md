# Definition and Scope

Definitions of interdisciplinarity range from selective borrowings across disciplines to knowledge fusion and synthesis (see, for example, (Klein, 1990)). Individual disciplines within interdisciplinarity may interact through integration, hierarchical relationships, or even antagonism (Barry et al., 2008). For the purposes of this primer, interdisciplinary and highly collaborative research (IHCR) is defined broadly as **research that combines resources and expertise across domains, communities, and institutions.** Two examples below illustrate complexities of IHCR projects and the varying scales of collaboration that may be involved.

The [International Polar Years (IPY)](https://www.pmel.noaa.gov/arctic-zone/ipy.html) were international collaborative efforts that focused on studying the polar regions. The first IPY was organized in 1882 - 1883 with researchers and observers collecting data from 12 stations in the Arctic and two in the sub-Antarctic (with more stations added later). Most recently, the fourth IPY took place in 2007 - 2008 with an estimated 50,000 participants from 60 nations. The data included physical, biological, and human observations of the land, ocean, and atmosphere “in every possible form and format” (Parsons et al., 2011). One of the major goals of this project was creating a robust data ecosystem and this proved to be extremely challenging, although some important lessons have been learned, *including the need to build collections and systems that are linked yet separate rather than integrated into one platform (Mokrane and Parsons, 2014).* 

The [Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC)](https://www.sesync.org/) in the US, funded by the National Science Foundation to the University of Maryland, focuses on interdisciplinary collaborations that help to understand how humans affect and respond to the environment. The Center supports multiple teams, each of which focuses on a specific aspect of socio-environmental research. Some teams integrate data and knowledge across biology and economics, while others combine behavioral and climate modeling. Datasets include biophysical measures and measures of human behavior or modeling processes and results (e.g., results from simulation software and processing scripts). It is common for such projects to undergo rapid changes in teams’ research methods, products, and even the nature of the questions addressed. The need to accommodate continuous changes in data and methodologies throughout the research lifecycle and the need for dedicated data and computational support across teams were among important lessons learned by the Center (Palmer, Kramer, Boyd & Hawthorne, 2016).

This primer encourages and provides guidance for **active curation** of data that comes from IHCR. Active curation refers to the expanded range of activities that include supporting project development, data collection, data management, and delivery and analytics in addition to documenting and enhancing data for preservation and sharing (Kouper et al., 2021). To accommodate an advocate for this expanded range of activities, the primer describes activities organized into two larger categories: the [CURATED steps](#curated-actions-to-consider) that focus on actions a curator takes at the end of the project and the [ACTIVE steps](#active-actions-to-consider), with the focus on curatorial or pre-curatorial actions during earlier stages of the project that enable data reuse.

Active curation and ACTIVE steps are particularly important for IHCR because it often involves higher complexity, disciplinary diversity, and idiosyncratic or project-specific combinations of tools, sources, and approaches. That is why decisions and context must be documented continually throughout the project to enable understanding and reuse. While some actions described below will help IHCR projects of the global and national nature, this primer will be most useful for “team-oriented” IHCR, which combines work of several communities or organizations on a smaller scale and can benefit from support of a smaller data management team. The primer is designed for both researchers and data practitioners, and will help these groups to understand how to prepare interdisciplinary data for long-term preservation and reuse. 


# Scenarios to Illustrate Curatorial Challenges

The three scenarios below come from the empirical research on IHCR data funded by the Institute of Museum and Library Services ([LG-246400-OLS-20](https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/lg-246400-ols-20)). The challenges identified in those scenarios along with a systematic literature review study (Kouper, 2023) became the foundation for the activities and recommendations that follow.


## Scenario 1: Same data, many software tools

A small team uses mixed methods to examine the food choices of older adults, combining expertise in anthropology, economics, and sociology. The data collection instruments include a survey questionnaire, interviews, photo documents and stories around them, and focus groups. During COVID19 the team also had to modify their data collection approach and shift from an online survey to paper mailing. This has changed some of the original data from born-digital to analog and in need of digitization. The group makes collaborative decisions about how to analyze data, but individuals lead specific efforts, depending on their preference and methodological expertise. The team uses several software, including Stata, R and Excel for quantitative processing and NVivo and R for qualitative processing. Several people are involved in cleaning, which generates several versions of “cleaned” datasets. Several people are also involved in transformations (e.g., adding variables for analysis), so more versions of datasets for analysis are being generated. The team has ways to number files (with version number and initials), but with multiple local downloads they have to discuss where the files are and which ones to use at every meeting and via email.

**Challenges**

- Multiple tools used at the same time
- Lack of consistent organization
- Incomplete planning
- Gaps in reproducibility
- Loss of context and metadata in transitioning between software
- Burden of manually documenting context and metadata across the entire workflow

## Scenario 2: Many producers, multiple datasets

A team works with spatial and survey data to create visual maps about green spaces and climate change in cities. The effort uses existing data, so focuses a lot on acquiring existing data, establishing use agreements, and then cleaning, aligning, and coordinating datasets to create derived datasets that become spatial online visualizations. Data sources have various temporal and spatial scales, all of which need to be aligned. Also, as frequency of updates is different, this information needs to be communicated in metadata. The team developed their own techniques of aligning the data, a lot is being done manually via Google spreadsheets and then uploaded to the platform (as layered shapefiles and data points that are visualized on the website). Various datasets are processed by individuals who are most familiar with that type of data (e.g., bike trails or green roofs). Data is then uploaded into ArcGIS for processing, with another expert doing the integration work. The work is not documented well and is probably not reproducible and not consistent across various datasets. Some datasets cannot be downloaded (only opened online), others have no documentation and proper guidelines.


**Challenges**

- Multiple formats (spreadsheets, geospatial)
- Inconsistent or lacking metadata
- Lack of consistent organization
- Proprietary formats
- Platform lock-in
- Absence of provenance and documentation
- Gaps in reproducibility

## Scenario 3: Variety of expertise, ethical negotiations

Team members work together to create historical maps of slavery-related events using digitized primary archival sources and statistical modeling. Work takes place in docs and spreadsheets, but then needs to be converted into ArcGIS and processed in R and Python. Work takes many iterations as terminology and interpretations need to be negotiated among historians, but then made suitable for statistical purposes. There is no metadata standard for this work, although the team incorporates Dublin Core. There is an effort to develop a controlled vocabulary to be consistent across various branches (subprojects). As the project focuses on historical persons and how to represent them in both research data and publications, team members engage in discussions about how to represent people from the past. Discussions can be informal and guided by mores and expectations in each field, or they can be expressed as requirements by a data provider or funder. Other considerations that are discussed include protecting privacy and confidentiality of individuals and their data and the need to avoid quantifying people and inadvertently reinforcing stereotypes or erasing nuances of their identities.


**Challenges**

- Multiple stages of data and its transformations (text, categories, statistical variables)
- Ethical dimensions and the need to balance qualitative and quantitative perspectives
- Creation of complex outputs that existing repository infrastructures may not handle well
- Lack of heuristics for decision-making
- No process for capturing the discussions that inform decision-making


# CURATED Actions to Consider

Interdisciplinarity and collaboration are intertwined, and may require more team effort, skills, and trust with implications for how data is collected, managed, and preserved. Data curation in IHCR involves dealing with higher complexity and diversity, while negotiating multiple tools, sources, and approaches. With such challenges, it becomes even more important for researchers and curators to collaborate early and practice active curation, i.e., work with data objects that are “live” and still being collected and analyzed.

IHCR data has no fixed forms or structures; it is complex and heterogeneous (as are the research processes that generate it), therefore the approaches to its curation need to account for fluidity, complexity, and heterogeneity. Curation actions may take place at various stages in the research process, and these actions could be undertaken by various research team members across institutions and/or by individuals external to the project (e.g., curators at a data repository). Below the [DCN CURATED workflow](http://z.umn.edu/curate) is described in the context of IHCR and additional actions that such curation may require.


## Check

*Contributors:* In addition to inventorying and reviewing the contents (files and code) and applying appraisal and selection criteria to the dataset, identify and review all data contributors and establish who is responsible for which parts of the data to be curated.

*Needed expertise:* Identify what domains are contributing to the dataset (collection) and ensure that the curation team has sufficient expertise. It is beneficial to have someone who knows how to work with two or more types of data (e.g., qualitative and quantitative, observational and simulations) and with two or more types of software. This sharing of expertise in data and software provides for more capacity to evaluate the objects to be curated.

*Repository options:* While the CURATED steps assume the data to be curated will reside in one repository, this assumption may not be appropriate for IHCR data. If there are multiple distinct data types produced by an IHCR project, one option is to utilize a repository that supports the represented data types or multiple disciplinary repositories if there is an expected or designated repository for each data type. References/links among related datasets are recommended if the repositories allow such a practice, and each dataset should have a persistent identifier associated with it. It is also preferable to deposit project-level data and documentation in a single repository, which provides potential users with a starting point for all of the contextual information (including locations of data sets housed in other repositories). A multidisciplinary data repository (e.g., [National Addiction & HIV Data Archive Program](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/NAHDAP/index.html), [DesignSafe Data Depot Repository](https://www.designsafe-ci.org/)), generalist repository (e.g., [OSF](https://osf.io/), [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)) or institutional repository (e.g., at the lead institution) may be well-suited for this purpose.

*Licensing, ownership models, and data use agreements:* Evaluate forms of collaboration and sharing, especially when data comes from collaborations with industry, government or community stakeholders and consider the following:

- Develop or review ownership guidelines and agreements among data creators and users early in the project. IHCR data is often a collection of data, so ownership may be distributed across team members and data may be acquired from multiple existing sources for secondary use. It is also important to review how existing data use agreements may or may not align with one another early in the project.
- Decide how data and software can or need to be licensed (see, for example, [https://guides.library.oregonstate.edu/research-data-services/data-licensing-ip](https://guides.library.oregonstate.edu/research-data-services/data-licensing-ip))
- Ensure that multiple formats are being preserved (see, for example, [U.S. National Archives and Records Administration Digital Preservation Framework (https://github.com/usnationalarchives/digital-preservation](https://github.com/usnationalarchives/digital-preservation))

## Understand

In examining the dataset (collection) closely to understand what it is, IHCR data also requires determining where it sits in disciplinary contexts. Common questions (steps) include:

- Identify domains and disciplines that contributed to the data and create a list to help determine curation expertise (e.g., disciplinary, computational, or data science expertise). Avoid generating hierarchies of disciplines or members contributing to the research.
- Determine whether one or more collaborating organizations contributed to the data and how that affects curation. For example, this could affect decisions about which organization’s repository will be used for the project.
- Determine the potential users of this data, including disciplines and expected levels of expertise and software and tools that are needed to open and interpret the various data formats.
- Use automation tools such as DROID File Identification Tool to correctly identify all file formats and create a dataset profile (Kaltman et al., 2021).


## Request

The quality of IHCR data curation depends on communication. When embarking on the active curation of IHCR data project, consider the following questions:

- Ask the researchers about their goals for sharing the dataset. Do they prioritize use for certain domains / stakeholders?
- Have all terminologies and practices been discussed and included in the description?
- In the case of large collaborative datasets, ask whether parts of the data is being published elsewhere and whether it needs to be linked.
- Offer to create a collaborative document that would serve as a READme file or high level documentation.
  - Within this document, consider including a high-level description of the data workflows from collection/generation through to curation.


## Augment

Capturing context through documentation is particularly challenging for IHCR. In contrast to disciplinary data and research involving smaller teams, it is often challenging to create documentation for IHCR data at the end of a project due to the number of people involved in creating it, the multiple data types and analysis tools used, and the various vocabularies and contextual metadata used by each discipline involved. In curating IHCR data consider providing more detailed documentation for IHCR data while recognizing that there is likely not a single standard or best practice to use. Data curators or other data specialists can provide valuable insight, e.g., create a data dictionary for structured elements to enable reuse across disciplines or by a more general audience.

- Capture necessary context by using multiple metadata standards or documentation best practices for each of the disciplines/data types involved in the project.
- Capture project-level documentation describing how the various data types relate to one another. For this project-specific documentation, README files offer a flexible way to capture context (see, for example, [https://data.research.cornell.edu/content/readme](https://data.research.cornell.edu/content/readme)).
- Consider adding authorship and acknowledgement statements to recognize all contributors.
- Make sure keywords that describe the project and data are broad enough to be inclusive of the interdisciplinary and collaborative context.
- Suggest adding an explicit statement about underlying principles of interdisciplinarity and collaboration to project-level description. Such a statement is most valuable when it is developed earlier in the project as part of consensus- and team-building efforts and data managers or curators can assist the team in developing such a statement. It includes a description of how the team approaches interdisciplinarity and collaboration (e.g., as borrowing, integration, synthesis, or dialog, (Klein, 2008; Miller, 2010).
- Develop common high-level vocabulary (tags) to identify and track papers and data shared and published in multiple venues as belonging to the larger project. 


## Transform

IHCR data may have a higher rate of transformations as data moves from one part of a team to another and from one disciplinary group to another. These transformations may not be documented throughout the project, so in addition to suggesting reusable and open formats, consider the following:

- Determine whether sufficient documentation exists to trace transformed data back to its original sources to understand what, when, why, and by whom changes were made.
- Consider how transformations in one part (domain orientation) of the data affect other parts of the data and ensure understanding and reusability of data throughout the project.
- Make sure that file format conversions are implemented through scripts/code, when possible,  rather than point/click operations to preserve reproducibility and roll-back if needed.
- Suggest a project-wide document for capturing data transformations that can be included in the final curated dataset (collection).


## Evaluate

In addition to assessing the data for adherence to FAIR, CARE, and other standards, evaluate the data and metadata for general readability and user-friendliness. Considering that IHCR data can be used by multiple audiences, such data needs to provide both jargon-free and specialized descriptions of data access, use, and ethical considerations. 

- Perform a final evaluation of how well data has been transformed to enable future preservation and use (e.g., levels of openness, reproducibility, and interoperability).
- Evaluate how curation can accommodate future changes in the deposited data (e.g., by ensuring that repository options support versioning or by creating a collection that accommodates additions).
- Verify that collections contain sufficient linkages between components even if FAIRness and other criteria cannot be fully met.
- If the data comes from an international collaboration, ensure that appropriate international frameworks for privacy, data ownership, etc., are included into consideration.


# ACTIVE Actions to Consider

The high-level suggestions described below aim to enable curators to promote active curation with an IHCR project and support IHCR teams in producing quality data and metadata from the beginning of the project. These ACTIVE actions are not meant to replace or stand apart from the CURATED steps, rather they provide a “‘wrapper” or a scaffolding structure that may help to identify where and how curators and researchers can work together and apply some or all of the CURATED steps. For example, the CURATED steps may be useful for verifying data (“V” in the ACTIVE model) as it moves from one part of the IHCR team to another. While these steps typically might only happen at the end of a non-IHCR project (e.g., by data curators at a repository), applying them iteratively throughout the ACTIVE model can benefit IHCR data curation.

> **A** - Advocate (advocate for curators or other data specialists to be included in IHCR teams, emphasize best practices and the importance of curation within IHCR teams, increase awareness of curation practices among the team members, establish communication practices around curation).<br>
> **C** - Collaborate (engage all project members in curation, collaborate on documentation, be open to contributions from all project members).<br>
> **T** - Test (test out curation actions that the rest of the group can adopt, including some software development or workflow modification, acknowledge and address admin and communication overhead).<br>
> **I** - Implement (implement best practices, recommendations, workflows, any systematic approach that improves practices).<br>
> **V** - Verify (check for accuracy and quality early on, coordinate among team members on applicable approaches and procedures, as curator takes lead on certain actions, verify fit with the team)<br>
> **E** - Engage (engage with broader community, promote IHCR practices, check-in regularly within the team to evaluate how well practices are working, etc.)<br>


## Advocate

It is critical for curators and other data specialists already embedded or working with an IHCR team to advocate for curation throughout the
project; however, there is also an important role for advocacy in encouraging IHCR teams to include curators or other data specialists in
their projects. In addition, curators working at academic institutions, for example, may not be aware of the full range of interdisciplinary activities on their campuses. To convince IHCR projects to build data curation into their workflows and to develop a model of support, data curators can develop a better understanding of relevant interdisciplinary activities on campus through formal mechanisms, such as surveys or through informal means, such as identifying projects within campus centers, institutes, or labs with an interdisciplinary orientation, or engaging in informal discussions with various campus stakeholders. Steps to include:

- Conduct an informal assessment (environmental scan) of IHCR initiatives on campus.

- Create a value statement that is tailored to IHCR.

- Build relationships with data curators on other campuses to share ideas and amplify outreach.

- Promote research data management consultations to IHCR and offer suggestions of best practices as a way to engage with teams during the planning and data collection and creation stages.

- Once a curator is working with an IHCR team, communicate the value of curation practices within the team early and often.

## Collaborate

IHCR projects benefit from active curation and lifecycle management.
While many data and research lifecycle models exist (see, for example, [https://www.usgs.gov/data-management/data-lifecycle](https://www.usgs.gov/data-management/data-lifecycle)), in simple terms research and data go through the stages of planning, data gathering, analysis, dissemination, archiving, and disposition. IHCR projects are often iterative, with each stage being done multiple times or spinning off into a separate project with its own lifecycle. Steps to collaborate on IHCR data curation throughout the lifecycle:

- Develop collaboration and communication expertise as part of curation support (e.g., help teams develop a project charter, see, for example, “[Implementing a Charter for IHCR Projects](https://inkouper.github.io/ihcr-data-curation/Project-charter.html)”).

- Discuss with project leaders the phases and iterations of their research and how data fits into each.

- Discuss methods for developing and maintaining common understanding and consistent terminology across research outputs.

- Consider alternatives to lifecycle (sequential) that accommodate IHCR better (e.g., [ecocycle planning](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/31-ecocycle-planning/)).

- Identify what key pieces of information (metadata) get communicated and what may be lost in transition between phases and collaborators.

- Identify units on campus, i.e., research computing, grant support, etc. that can offer relevant assistance at different stages of the lifecycle. and promote collaborative relationships with these campus units.

- Develop curation strategies for IHCR data that go beyond disciplinary or institutional repositories. For example, IHCR projects often develop custom interfaces for publishing data, which can create challenges for long-term preservation.

## Test

IHCR projects vary significantly in scope (level of interdisciplinarity) and size (number of individuals/institutions involved) and resources available for curation. One-size-fits-all approaches to active curation are unlikely to work for all projects, so it is important to test curation actions, either from the CURATED steps or the ones that were developed specifically for the project, before implementing fully across the team. While piloting certain approaches is the best way to test them, it may not be feasible. In such cases, discussing alternatives and
brainstorming options is another way to approach testing.

- Discuss roles and responsibilities with regard to data.

- Develop information storage and organization plan and solicit feedback from the team (see “[Organizing Information and Data for Interdisciplinary Projects](https://inkouper.github.io/ihcr-data-curation/Info-org.html)").

- Review a version control system of the project and the processes for integrating changes into “master” datasets.

## Implement

Once the need for active curation has been established and curation best practices, workflows, and processes have been tested successfully, curation activities can be implemented across the team. Steps to consider:

- Provide templates (e.g., for metadata/readmes) and other documentation (e.g., who to contact for help with curation actions, workflow descriptions) at the beginning of implementation.

- Use literate programming, i.e., explain data processing logic in both code and natural language to make it easily understandable for people outside the immediate group of experts (Kery et al., 2018).

  - Tools to consider for documentation and recordkeeping: Jupyter notebooks, R Markdown, Google Colab, [electronic lab notebooks](https://datamanagement.hms.harvard.edu/analyze/electronic-lab-notebooks).

- Identify opportunities to streamline software that is used in the group. The proliferation of different software that implements similar tasks can lead to confusion; where possible, it is preferable to identify opportunities to eliminate redundant software (for example, if R, SPSS, and Stata are all being used by different group members for similar tasks, it may be preferable to converge on one software choice, so as to eliminate confusion and facilitate future reproducibility).

- Explore the possibility of containerization tools (i.e., Docker) to facilitate reproducibility across different computing environments

- Ensure canonical data files (i.e., data that will eventually be published and preserved) use open and documented formats when moving from one part of the team to another

- Write an “internal” data management plan that is more detailed than those submitted to funding agencies that lays out expectations, procedures, best practices, and strategies to ensure interoperability as they relate to data use and management (this could be embedded within the project charter). Use this document as part of the onboarding process for new group members.

- Ensure equity in how project members access and use the resources they need (for example, computing environments with sufficient memory and processing power).

## Verify

Given how IHCR data is often transformed and combined with other data as it moves across different individuals and groups with the team, it is important to verify early and regularly that active curation processes are working as intended and that changes to data are documented appropriately and do not undermine data quality. Steps to consider:

- Implement a data quality framework to use at various stages of the project. This could address such dimensions as accessibility, completeness, consistency, relevancy, timeliness, and value. For more quality dimensions, see, for example, (Pipino, Lee, & Wang, 2002). Simple checklists, such as the [Data Quality Review Checklist](https://daac.ornl.gov/submit/qachecklist/), can be used for a simple implementation. A more elaborate approach would include automated checks and validation. The CURATED steps could also be used as a way to verify data quality at important points in the research process.

- Regularly check with the team that data management and curation meets their expectations.

- Document time spent on data curation and evaluate its impact on research outcomes.

## Engage

As IHCR curation practices are varied and still emerging, successful implementations are important to share with the broader community. Continued engagement within IHCR teams is also an important aspect of active curation to ensure adherence to best practices, procedures, and workflows throughout the project. Steps to consider:

- Document how active curation processes benefit the project to reinforce the work done in the [Advocate](#advocate) stage.

- Monitor changes in tools, storage options, environments, formats, costs, and other essential aspects of IHCR data curation and share results with IHCR teams.

- Promote hiring or training data management specialists within IHCR teams.
