Snowstorm Database

The [Snowstorm Database] (https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/metadata/geoportal/rest/metadata/item/gov.noaa.ncdc:C00464/html#) is a collection of over 500 snowstorms dating back to 1900 and updated operationally. Only storms having large areas of heavy snowfall (10-20 inches or greater) are included. The data is archived in shapefile format, one shapefile per storm. The data is archived in shapefile format, one shapefile per storm.

TIGER/Line Shapefiles 

The [TIGER/Line Shapefiles] (https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.2023.html#list-tab-790442341) are extracts of selected geographic and cartographic information from the Census Bureau's Master Address File (MAF)/Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (TIGER) system. The shapefiles include information for the fifty states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Island  areas (American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and the United States Virgin Islan]ds). The shapefiles include polygon boundaries of geographic areas and features, linear features including roads and hydrography, and point features.

7.  Resources for reviewing data (ww)

In the process of working with shapefile data, it's crucial to have access to reliable resources for reviewing and understanding the intricacies of the data. Here's a session dedicated to exploring various resources that can aid in the comprehensive review of shapefile data:
Official Documentation: Start with the official documentation provided by the organization or platform that created or maintains the shapefile format. This documentation often includes detailed specifications, data structure explanations, and usage guidelines.
Software Manuals: If you're using specific GIS software to work with shapefiles, refer to its manuals. These manuals usually offer insights into how the software handles shapefiles, data manipulation techniques, and troubleshooting tips.

8.  Software for viewing or analyzing data (kb)

9.  Preservation actions (ww)

Preservation actions are crucial for ensuring the longevity, integrity, and accessibility of shapefile data. Here's a session dedicated to exploring various preservation actions that can help safeguard shapefile data for future use:
Regular Backups: Establish a routine schedule for backing up shapefile data to secure storage locations, such as external hard drives, cloud storage services, or network servers.
Comprehensive Metadata: Create and maintain comprehensive metadata records for shapefile datasets, including information about data source, creation date, projection, attribute definitions, and data quality.
Standardized Metadata Formats: Adhere to standardized metadata formats, such as FGDC (Federal Geographic Data Committee) or ISO (International Organization for Standardization), to ensure consistency and interoperability.
Regular Format Checks: Periodically assess the compatibility of shapefile data with current and emerging GIS software and standards. Consider migrating data to more sustainable formats, such as GeoPackage or Esri File Geodatabase, if necessary.
Data Conversion Tools: Use data conversion tools and utilities to facilitate the migration of shapefile data between different file formats while preserving spatial and attribute information.


10. What to look for to make sure this file meets FAIR principles (ww)

Ensuring that shapefile data adheres to the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) is essential for maximizing its value and impact within the GIS (Geographic Information Systems) community. Here's a session dedicated to outlining key considerations for evaluating shapefile data to ensure compliance with FAIR principles:

10.1 Findable:
Descriptive Metadata: Assess whether the shapefile data is accompanied by comprehensive metadata that provides detailed descriptions of its content, purpose, spatial extent, attributes, and provenance.
Persistent Identifiers: Verify the presence of persistent identifiers, such as DOIs (Digital Object Identifiers) or URLs, that uniquely identify the shapefile dataset and facilitate its discovery and citation in data repositories.

10.2 Accessible:
Open Access Policies: Ensure that shapefile data is made openly accessible to users without unnecessary restrictions or barriers, adhering to open access policies and licensing agreements.
Data Repositories: Check if the shapefile dataset is deposited in trusted data repositories or archives that provide reliable access mechanisms, such as download links, APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), or web services.

10.3 Interoperable:
Standardized Formats: Evaluate whether the shapefile data is stored in standardized formats that are widely supported and interoperable with various GIS software and systems, such as ESRI Shapefile or GeoPackage.
Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS): Verify that the shapefile data is georeferenced using standard coordinate reference systems and projections, enabling seamless integration with other spatial datasets.

10.4 Reusable:
Licensing Information: Review the licensing terms associated with the shapefile data to determine the permissions and conditions for its reuse, redistribution, and modification by users.
Data Quality Assurance: Assess the quality and reliability of the shapefile data by examining metadata completeness, spatial accuracy, attribute consistency, and adherence to relevant standards.

10.5 Additional Considerations:
Versioning and Provenance: Look for versioning information and provenance records that document the history of changes, updates, and transformations applied to the shapefile dataset over time.
Data Documentation: Ensure that the shapefile data is accompanied by comprehensive documentation, including data dictionaries, field descriptions, processing methodologies, and data transformation records.

10.6 Tools and Resources:
FAIR Assessment Tools: Explore FAIR assessment tools and frameworks, such as FAIRshake or FAIR Metrics, that provide structured methodologies for evaluating the compliance of shapefile data with FAIR principles.
Community Guidelines: Refer to community guidelines, best practices, and case studies developed by the GIS community to promote FAIR data sharing and stewardship in the context of spatial data.
