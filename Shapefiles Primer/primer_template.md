Snowstorm Database

The [Snowstorm Database] (https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/metadata/geoportal/rest/metadata/item/gov.noaa.ncdc:C00464/html#) is a collection of over 500 snowstorms dating back to 1900 and updated operationally. Only storms having large areas of heavy snowfall (10-20 inches or greater) are included. The data is archived in shapefile format, one shapefile per storm. The data is archived in shapefile format, one shapefile per storm.

TIGER/Line Shapefiles 

The [TIGER/Line Shapefiles] (https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.2023.html#list-tab-790442341) are extracts of selected geographic and cartographic information from the Census Bureau's Master Address File (MAF)/Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (TIGER) system. The shapefiles include information for the fifty states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Island  areas (American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and the United States Virgin Islan]ds). The shapefiles include polygon boundaries of geographic areas and features, linear features including roads and hydrography, and point features.

Geospatial Data Repositories:

GeoPlatform

[GeoPlatform] (https://www.geoplatform.gov) suports discovery and registering geospatial data assets with special emphasis on 177 NationalGeospatial Data Assets (NGDAs) across 18 data themes as guided by the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDIC).

The Big Ten Academic Alliance Geospatial Information Network (BTAA-GIN)

[BTAA-GIN] (https://btaa.org/library/programs-and-services/geoportal) is a collaboration of library-affiliated staff from Big Ten Academic Alliance universities. The program aims to support the geospatial research community by building and maintaining a collective open-source spatial data infrastructure featuring metadata optimized for spatial discovery platforms.  The BTAA Geoportal contains images, scanned maps, and geospatial data in Shapefile format.

7.  Resources for reviewing data (ww)
In the process of working with shapefile data, it's crucial to have access to reliable resources for reviewing and understanding the intricacies of the data. Here's a session dedicated to exploring various resources that can aid in the comprehensive review of shapefile data:
Official Documentation: Start with the official documentation provided by the organization or platform that created or maintains the shapefile format. This documentation often includes detailed specifications, data structure explanations, and usage guidelines.
Software Manuals: If you're using specific GIS software to work with shapefiles, refer to its manuals. These manuals usually offer insights into how the software handles shapefiles, data manipulation techniques, and troubleshooting tips.

8.  Software for viewing or analyzing data (kb)

9.  Preservation actions (ww)

10. What to look for to make sure this file meets FAIR principles (ww)

11. Ways in which fields may use this format (ww)

12. Unresolved Issues/Further Questions \[for example: tracking
